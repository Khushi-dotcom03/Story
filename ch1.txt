Chapter 1: The Commit  
----------------------  

The file had been empty for too long. Lines of code and words of wisdom waited in the void,  
aching to be written. And then, with a single keystroke, the change began.  

"This is it," they whispered. "The first commit."  

Would it be accepted? Would it pass the tests of time and reviewers?  
Only the repository knew.  

With a deep breath, the coder typed:  

git add ch.txt  
git commit -m "The beginning of something great."  

And so, the journey began... ðŸš€
