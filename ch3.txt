Chapter 3: The Merge  
----------------------  

All was not as simple as it seemed.  
A new branch had appeared, carrying changes unknown.  

Conflicts brewed in the code, a battle between versions.  
The coder knew what had to be done.  

With steady hands, they typed:  

git merge feature-branch  

Warnings flashed. Lines clashed.  
But through patience and precision, harmony was restored.  

The repository stood united once more.  
The coder leaned back, victorious.  

But little did they know... another change was coming.
